# Behanced

Behance, _enhanced_. A simple, minimalist Adobe Behance clone built with React, JavaScript ES6, Babel, webpack, Sass, axios, and the Behance API.

**Card/UI design refinements & improvements:**

* Developed navigation bar with popular fields as data filters
* Created nav dropdown menu component with all available creative fields
* Added multiple creative fields/categories, as available, overlaid on card image
* Decreased number of cards to 4 per row for easier readability and browsing
* Increased project title font size for clearer hierarchy
* Added project owner avatars
* Added project published date
* Added number of comments
* Abbreviated large numbers for appreciations, views, and comments

**Potential additional features to be implemented:**

* Open project modal component on card click and display all project content, images, etc.
* Add curated gallery section
* Add search for projects functionality
* Add search for users functionality
* Add sort functionality (by appreciations, views, comments)
